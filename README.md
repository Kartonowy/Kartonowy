## hi oh :wave:

CS student in Polando

Currently rocking on Void Linux.

i like games, and cli tools
have some experience in different things

i kinda like low level and if i were to choose between c++ 
and css i'd still pick c++ (rather c to be honest)

even tho im learning a lot different things at CS course i learn a lot by myself
