## hi oh :wave:

CS student in Polando

Currently rocking on Void Linux with neovim & sway wm.

i like games and cli tools

i have some experience in a lot of different things

i kinda like low level and if i were to choose between c++ 
and css i'd still pick c++ (rather c to be honest (zig?))

even tho im learning a lot different things at CS course i learn a lot by myself, rust mostly
